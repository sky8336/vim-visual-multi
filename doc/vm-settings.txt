SETTINGS                                                *visual-multi-settings*
===============================================================================

Hopefully you won't need to alter any of these.


*g:VM_highlight_matches*                           Default: 'underline'

  Controls VM default highlighting style for patterns matched, but not
  selected. Possible useful values are 'underline' and 'red'.
  Otherwise an empty string if you want the normal |Search| highlight, or
  a full highlight command (help |:hi|), e.g.:  >
    let g:VM_highlight_matches = 'hi Search ctermfg=228 cterm=underline'
    let g:VM_highlight_matches = 'hi! link Search PmenuSel'
<
*g:VM_keep_buffer_hl*                              Default: 1

  If 0, VM will use clearmatches() to clear VM highlight. It's faster but it is
  not compatible with plugins that apply special highlights.
  `b:VM_keep_buffer_hl` will override this setting, if defined.


*g:VM_set_statusline*                              Default: 2

  Enable statusline when VM is active.
  With a value of 1, the statusline will be set once, on VM start.
  With a value of 2, the statusline will be refreshed on |CursorHold| event.
  With a value of 3, also on |CursorMoved| event.


*g:VM_skip_shorter_lines*                          Default: 1

  When adding cursors up/down, skip shorter lines.


*g:VM_skip_empty_lines*                            Default: 0

  When adding cursors up/down, skip empty lines.


*g:VM_live_editing*                                Default: 1

  Controls how often text is updated in insert mode.


*g:VM_filesize_limit*                              Default: 0 (disabled)

  VM won't start if buffer size is greater.


*g:VM_reselect_first*                              Default: 0

  The first region will be reselected after most commands, if set to 1.


*g:VM_case_setting*                                Default: 'smart'

  Starting case matching for patterns. Other values: 'sensitive', 'ignore'
  Can be switched inside VM.


*g:VM_disable_syntax_in_imode*                     Default: 0

  You could want to do it for performance reasons.


*g:VM_exit_on_1_cursor_left*                       Default: 0

  Automatically exit VM if there's a single cursor left after a command.


*g:VM_custom_remaps*                               Default: {}

  To remap VM keys. See |vm-faq-remap|.


*g:VM_single_mode_maps*                            Default: 1

Set to 0 to disable entirely insert mode mappings to cycle cursors in
|vm-single-mode|. If you only want to change the default mappings, see
|vm-buffer-mappings|.


*g:VM_insert_special_keys*                         Default: ['c-a', 'c-e', 'c-v']

  Some keys in insert mode have a different behaviour, compared to vim
  defaults. If you don't some or any them, remove them from the list.

  <C-A> go to the beginning of the line, at indent level (same as <Esc>I)
  <C-E> go to the end of the line (same as <Esc>A)
  <C-V> paste from VM unnamed register


*g:VM_silent_exit*                                 Default: 0

  Don't display a message when exiting VM. It can be useful if you already set
  up statusline integration.




HIGHLIGHT                                              *visual-multi-highlight*
===============================================================================


VM default theme is based on your color scheme, if you don't like it you can:

* select a theme
* relink highlight groups
                                                                   *g:VM_theme*
You can load a theme by default by defining:  >
    let g:VM_theme = 'your_chosen_theme'
<                                                                    *:VMTheme*
If you want to change theme, run: >
    :VMTheme
<
To relink VM highlight groups: >

  let g:VM_Mono_hl   = 'DiffText'
  let g:VM_Extend_hl = 'DiffAdd'
  let g:VM_Cursor_hl = 'Visual'
  let g:VM_Insert_hl = 'DiffChange'
<
*g:VM_Mono_hl*    is the highlight in cursor mode
*g:VM_Extend_hl*  ,, in extend mode (the selections)
*g:VM_Cursor_hl*  ,, in extend mode (the cursors)
*g:VM_Insert_hl*  ,, in insert mode (the virtual cursors)
